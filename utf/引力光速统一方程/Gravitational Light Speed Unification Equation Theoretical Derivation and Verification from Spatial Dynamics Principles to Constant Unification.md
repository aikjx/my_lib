Authors: Guozi Mo, Xiangqian Zhang

## Abstract

Based on the first principles of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, this paper rigorously mathematically derives and physically models, for the first time, a profound quantitative relationship between the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$, establishing the landmark Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation:

$$Z = \frac{Gc}{2}$$

Here, the gravitational-light speed unification constant $Z$ is the Zhang Xiangqian Constant, whose physical meaning is the rate of change of the number of spatial displacement lines per unit time and unit volume (density flow of spatial divergence), with dimensions $[M]^{-1}[L]^{4}[T]^{-3}$ (unit: $\text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$).

**Core Research Achievements**: 
1. **High Agreement Between Theory and Experiment**: When using the precise value $Z = 0.0100065 \, \text{kg}^{-1}·\text{m}^4·\text{s}^{-3}$, the theoretically calculated gravitational constant is highly consistent with the CODATA 2018 recommended value, with a relative error of only 0.02%; even with the approximate value $Z = 0.01$, the error is only 0.045%, demonstrating extremely high prediction accuracy.
2. **Self-consistent and Unified Theoretical System**: By cross-validating this equation with 17 core formulas of the Unified Field Theory (including electromagnetic field equations, dynamic equations, etc.), it is confirmed to be completely mathematically and physically consistent with the entire theoretical system, forming a core component of the theory.
3. **Cross-disciplinary Universality Verification**: Systematic analysis shows that this equation can naturally integrate into core formulas of multiple physics fields such as general relativity (Einstein field equations, Schwarzschild radius), quantum gravity (Planck mass), cosmology (Friedmann equation), and Newtonian mechanics, demonstrating wide applicability and unity.

**Scientific Significance and Innovative Value**: 
This research breaks through the traditional cognition since Newton that "the gravitational constant $G$ is a basic empirical constant that cannot be derived," and for the first time reveals the physical origin of the gravitational constant from first principles, constructing a mathematical bridge for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force. By defining mass as a measure of the number of spatial displacement lines and revealing that gravity originates from the geometric effect of spatial light-speed divergent motion, this theory provides a revolutionary geometric perspective for understanding the essence of spacetime, matter, and forces, which is expected to trigger profound changes in the basic physics framework. At the same time, the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$, as a key constant connecting gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, also provides a solid mathematical and physical foundation for "artificial field technology," with far-reaching significance for the future development of interstellar civilizations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Historical Evolution of Gravitational Theories and Scientific Significance of Unified Field Theory

Gravity, as the most fundamental and profound interaction in nature, has spanned the centuries-long development of physics, with its research progress deeply reflecting the deepening of humanity's understanding of the essence of nature.

In 1687, Newton proposed the law of universal gravitation in his "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy," quantifying gravitational interaction for the first time with a mathematical formula:

$$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2} \tag{1-1}$$

This elegantly simple inverse-square law successfully explained numerous astronomical observations such as planetary motion and tides. However, Newton himself remained skeptical about the nature of gravity, viewing its action-at-a-distance as an "incomprehensible mysterious force." Most crucially, **the gravitational constant $G$ in Newton's theory is merely an empirical parameter, and why its value is so small (approximately on the order of $10^{-11}$) remains an unsolved mystery in physics**.

In 1915, Einstein published the general theory of relativity, completely revolutionizing humanity's understanding of gravity—gravity was no longer viewed as action-at-a-distance but interpreted as a geometric effect of spacetime curvature. The Einstein field equation profoundly revealed the relationship between matter-energy and spacetime geometry:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} \tag{1-2}$$

Despite the tremendous success of general relativity at macroscopic scales, its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and its inability to unify with electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces remain among the greatest challenges facing modern physics. Einstein devoted his later years to unified field theory research, attempting to establish a unified theory describing all fundamental interactions, but ultimately did not succeed. Notably, in the Einstein field equation, the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are still two seemingly independent fundamental constants, and their deep connection has yet to be revealed.

Since Einstein, countless physicists have made unremitting efforts to achieve the unification of forces—from the extra-dimensional attempts of Kaluza-Klein theory, to Weyl's exploration of gauge invariance, and to modern frontier theories such as superstring theory and loop quantum gravity. However, the problem of unifying gravity and electromagnetic force has never been satisfactorily resolved. This predicament not only reflects the limitations of our understanding of the essence of nature but also underscores the urgency of establishing a more complete theoretical system.

### 1.2 Innovative Ideas and Theoretical Breakthroughs of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory

Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory provides new possibilities for the path to unification in physics with its unique perspective and innovative concepts. The core revolutionary idea of this theory lies in: **space is not a passive, static background stage, but a physical entity with intrinsic dynamic properties**. This concept completely subverts the traditional view since Newton that regards space as an "absolute container," elevating space to an active role participating in physical processes.

Key innovations of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory include:

1. **Dynamic Nature of Spatial Motion**: The theory proposes that the space around any object in the universe is always diverging in a cylindrical helical motion at the speed of light $c$. This hypothesis provides a completely new physical picture for understanding fundamental interactions such as gravity and electromagnetic force—the essence of force is the effect produced by changes in the state of spatial motion.

2. **Geometric Definition of Mass**: Mass is no longer viewed as "the amount of matter contained in an object" but redefined as a measure of the degree of light-speed divergent motion of the surrounding space. This definition achieves the unification of mass with spatial geometric properties, laying a conceptual foundation for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force.

3. **Mechanistic Explanation for the Constancy of Light Speed**: The theory provides a mechanistic explanation for "why the speed of light is constant"—light speed is the movement speed of space itself, not merely the propagation speed of electromagnetic waves. This explanation transforms the constancy of light speed from a "fundamental assumption" to a "natural result of spatial properties," deepening our understanding of the essence of spacetime.

4. **Geometric Origin of Charge**: The theory proposes a completely new explanation for the essence of charge, suggesting that charge $q$ is "the rate of change of unit solid angle" ($q \propto d\Omega/dt$), "mass in motion," and a product of剧烈 changes in spatial solid angle. This explanation provides new ideas for the unification of electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena, suggesting they may share a common geometric origin.

### 1.3 Scientific Status and Research Objectives of the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation

Within the theoretical framework of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, this paper, through rigorous mathematical derivation, reveals for the first time the quantitative relationship between the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ from first principles, deriving the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation.

The core research objectives of this paper are:

1. **Revealing the Theoretical Origin of the Gravitational Constant**: Breaking through the limitation of traditional physics that regards the gravitational constant $G$ as a fundamental experimentally measured value, theoretically deriving the mathematical expression of $G$, and explaining the physical origin of its numerical characteristics.

2. **Establishing a Mathematical Bridge Between Gravity and Electromagnetic Force**: Through the quantitative relationship between $G$ and $c$, providing a key mathematical foundation for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force, and exploring the unity of fundamental interactions in nature.

3. **Verifying the Self-Consistency of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory**: Systematically verifying the intrinsic consistency between the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation and the core formulas of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, further testing the logical rigor and physical rationality of this theory.

4. **Expanding the Application Scope of Unified Field Theory**: Exploring the universality of the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation in multiple physics fields such as general relativity, quantum gravity, and cosmology, providing new perspectives and tools for theoretical research in these fields.

5. **Providing a Theoretical Foundation for Future Technologies**: Providing a solid mathematical and physical foundation for frontier technologies such as "artificial field technology," and exploring its potential applications in energy, aerospace, materials science, and other fields.

This research not only provides a new perspective for understanding the nature of gravity but also offers important clues for exploring the grand unification of physics, which is expected to bring new insights to the field of theoretical physics.

## 2. Basic Postulates of Spatial Dynamics Theory

Spatial dynamics theory is the core framework of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, aiming to unify fundamental interactions such as gravity and electromagnetic force, and reveal the essential connections between spacetime, matter, and forces. This theory breaks through the limitation of traditional physics viewing space as a static background, and for the first time elevates space to a physical entity with intrinsic dynamic properties, providing a new perspective for understanding the basic laws of the universe.

The entire system of spatial dynamics theory is built upon the following six **logically self-consistent core postulates**, which together form a conceptually clear theoretical framework, providing a solid foundation for subsequent mathematical derivations and physical verifications:

### 2.1 Postulate of Universal Composition: The Most Fundamental Elements of the Physical World

**Postulate Content**: The universe is composed of only two basic entities: objects and space. There is no third entity that coexists with them. Apart from objects and space, everything else is a description or measurement by observers of the motion of objects and the motion of space itself.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate establishes the ontological foundation of spatial dynamics theory, clearly distinguishing the essential differences between physical entities (objects and space) and physical phenomena (motion, fields, energy, etc.). It negates the necessity of hypotheses such as "ether" and reduces the complex physical world to its most basic constituent elements, laying a concise and solid philosophical foundation for unified field theory.

**Mathematical Expression**: From an ontological perspective, we can represent the universe as a binary tuple:

$$\text{Universe} = \{\text{Objects}, \text{Space}\} \tag{2-1}$$

This expression clearly indicates that space and objects are two independent yet interrelated basic elements constituting the physical world, and all physical phenomena originate from the interaction between them.

### 2.2 Postulate of Spacetime Identity: The Essential Connection Between Time and Space

**Postulate Content**: Time and space are different manifestations of the same physical entity, and they satisfy the mathematical relationship—the spacetime identity equation:

$$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{C}t=x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}+z\vec{k} \tag{2-2}$$

Where $\vec{r}$ is the spatial displacement vector, $\vec{C}$ is the vector speed of light (whose magnitude is the scalar speed of light $c$), $t$ is time, $x$, $y$, $z$ are spatial coordinate components, and $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$, $\vec{k}$ are unit vectors of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate reveals the essence of time—time is not an independent physical dimension but a measure of spatial displacement. It explains the physical mechanism of the principle of constancy of light speed—the speed of light is essentially the motion speed of space itself, rather than the motion speed of objects in the traditional sense. This explanation transforms the basic assumption of relativity into a natural result of spatial properties, providing a new theoretical framework for understanding the unity of spacetime, while also laying a conceptual foundation for the subsequent derivation of the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

**Mathematical Properties**: From the spacetime identity equation, we can derive the dimensional relationship between time and space:

$$[t] = \frac{[L]}{[LT^{-1}]} = [T] \tag{2-3}$$

This relationship verifies the physical rationality of time as a measure of spatial displacement.

### 2.3 Postulate of Spatial Motion: The Dynamic Nature of Space

**Postulate Content**: For any object in the universe, the surrounding space is always diverging in a cylindrical helical motion at the speed of light $c$. This motion is absolute and independent of the physical state of the object.

**Physical Significance**: This is the core postulate of spatial dynamics theory, which breaks through the concept of traditional physics viewing space as a static background and elevates space to a physical entity with intrinsic dynamic properties. This postulate provides a new physical image for understanding the nature of gravity and electromagnetic force—gravity and electromagnetic force are essentially manifestations of the interaction of spatial motion and direct results of spatial geometric properties.

**Mathematical Expression**: The cylindrical helical motion of space can be described by the three-dimensional helical spacetime equation:

$$\vec{r}(t) = r\cos\omega t \cdot \vec{i} + r\sin\omega t \cdot \vec{j} + ht \cdot \vec{k} \tag{2-4}$$

Where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $h$ is the pitch parameter, and these two parameters jointly determine the properties of spatial waves. This equation shows that the motion of space has not only a radial component (corresponding to the gravitational field) but also a rotational component (corresponding to the electromagnetic field), thus providing a mathematical foundation for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force.

### 2.4 Postulate of Geometric Definition of Mass: The Spatial Origin of Mass

**Postulate Content**: The mass of an object is a geometric measure of the degree of light-speed divergent motion of its surrounding space, satisfying the mass definition equation:

$$m = k \cdot \frac{dn}{d\Omega} \tag{2-5}$$

Where $k$ is the proportionality constant, $\frac{dn}{d\Omega}$ is the density of spatial displacement lines per unit solid angle, and $d\Omega$ is the solid angle element.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate revolutionizes physics' understanding of the essence of mass—mass is no longer viewed as the "amount of matter contained in an object" but is redefined as a geometric measure of the degree of light-speed divergent motion of its surrounding space. This definition reveals the essential connection between mass and spatial motion, unifying matter and space within the same physical framework, and providing a core theoretical foundation for deriving the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

**Mathematical Properties**: For spherically symmetric cases, the mass definition equation can be simplified to:

$$M = k \cdot 4\pi r^2 \cdot n_r \tag{2-6}$$

Where $n_r$ is the density of spatial displacement lines per unit solid angle in the radial direction. This simplified form more clearly demonstrates the quantitative relationship between mass and spatial divergent motion.

### 2.5 Postulate of Field Unity: The Common Origin of Force Fields

**Postulate Content**: Gravitational field, electromagnetic field, and nuclear force field are not independent entities but manifestations of the same spacetime motion (cylindrical helical motion) under different conditions. The four fundamental interactions have a common geometric origin and are essentially manifestations of the same physical mechanism at different scales and dimensions.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate provides a new approach to solving the long-standing problem of field unification in physics. It points out that the four seemingly different fundamental interactions in nature (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force) are actually macroscopic manifestations of the same spatial motion pattern at different scales and under different conditions. This unified view simplifies the description of the physical world and provides a clear direction and theoretical framework for establishing a complete unified field theory.

**Mathematical Connection**: The mathematical connections between various fields can be described by the different manifestations of the angular frequency $\omega$ and pitch parameter $h$ in the three-dimensional helical spacetime equation. For example, the gravitational field mainly reflects the radial component of spatial motion (related to the pitch parameter $h$), while the electromagnetic field mainly reflects the rotational component of spatial motion (related to the angular frequency $\omega$).

### 2.6 Postulate of Geometric Definition of Force: The Spatial Essence of Force

**Postulate Content**: All forces in physics are essentially geometric manifestations of changes in the state of spatial motion, satisfying the universal unification equation (force equation):

$$\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}  \tag{2-7}$$

Where $\vec{P}$ is the momentum vector.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate reduces the essence of force from the traditional "interaction between objects" to "changes in the state of spatial motion," unifying the understanding of various forces. According to spatial dynamics theory, momentum $\vec{P}$ can be expressed as:

$$\overrightarrow{P}=m(\overrightarrow{C}-\overrightarrow{V}) \tag{2-8}$$

Where $\mathbf{V}$ is the motion speed of the object. Substituting this expression into the force definition equation, we can obtain:

$$F = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt} = \vec{C}\frac{dm}{dt} - \vec{V}\frac{dm}{dt} + m\frac{d\vec{C}}{dt} - m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt} \tag{2-9}$$

The four terms of this equation correspond to different types of forces:
- First term $\vec{C}\frac{dm}{dt}$: Corresponding to electric field force
- Second term $- \vec{V}\frac{dm}{dt}$: Corresponding to magnetic field force
- Third term $m\frac{d\vec{C}}{dt}$: Corresponding to nuclear force
- Fourth term $- m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}$: Corresponding to inertial force and universal gravitation

This decomposition method provides a clear mathematical framework for understanding the unification of the four fundamental interactions.

## 3. Definition of Mass and Spatial Motion

### 3.1 Mass as a Measure of Spatial Displacement Lines

According to Postulate 3 of spatial dynamics theory, mass is a measure of the number of spatial displacement lines. This is a revolutionary redefinition that completely abandons the traditional view of mass as an inherent property of matter and instead views mass as a manifestation of spatial motion.

In Unified Field Theory, spatial displacement lines are defined as the paths along which space moves from one point to another. The density of these lines reflects the intensity of spatial motion. For an object with mass $m$, its mass can be expressed as the area integral of spatial displacement line density over the surface of the object:

$$m = \oint_S \rho \cdot dS$$

Where $S$ is the surface area of the object, and $\rho$ is the density of spatial displacement lines on the surface.

### 3.2 Relationship Between Mass and Spatial Motion

For a spherical object with radius $R$ and uniform spatial displacement line density, the above formula can be simplified to:

$$m = 4\pi R^2 \cdot \rho$$

This formula shows that the mass of an object is proportional to its surface area and the density of spatial displacement lines on its surface, which reveals the geometric nature of mass.

In addition, according to Postulate 2, space is in a three-dimensional helical motion. The linear component of this motion corresponds to the translational motion of objects, while the rotational component corresponds to the rotational motion and intrinsic properties (such as spin) of objects. The relationship between mass and spatial motion can be further expressed as:

$$m = \alpha \cdot \frac{v}{\omega} \cdot \rho$$

Where $v$ is the linear velocity of spatial motion, $\omega$ is the angular velocity, and $\alpha$ is a proportionality constant.

### 3.3 Spacetime Identity Geometric Effects

According to Postulate 1, space and time are essentially the same physical entity, and time is the movement of space. This principle leads to important geometric effects, which we can express mathematically as:

$$ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2$$

This is similar to the spacetime interval in special relativity, but in Unified Field Theory, it has a deeper physical meaning: it directly reflects the relationship between spatial displacement and time change.

The physical essence of time lies in the continuity and irreversibility of spatial motion. The "flow" of time we perceive is actually the result of the continuous motion of space. This understanding helps us reveal the geometric origin of gravity from a new perspective.

### 3.4 Physical Verification of the Geometric Definition of Mass

The geometric definition of mass has received preliminary verification in some physical phenomena. For example, in particle physics, the mass of elementary particles is closely related to their quantum field properties, which can be understood as different manifestations of spatial motion. In addition, the mass-energy equivalence formula $E=mc^2$ also supports this view: energy is a form of spatial motion, and mass is a concentrated form of this motion.

Our subsequent derivations will further verify the correctness of this definition and reveal its profound significance in gravitational theory.

## 4. Geometric Origin of Gravitational Field

### 4.1 Definition of Gravitational Field Based on Spatial Divergence

According to Postulate 4 of spatial dynamics theory, the gravitational field is a manifestation of the divergence of spatial motion. This definition provides us with a new perspective to understand the nature of gravity.

In vector analysis, divergence represents the source or sink of a vector field. In the context of spatial dynamics, the divergence of spatial velocity field represents the rate at which space is "created" or "annihilated" per unit volume. For a gravitational field, the gravitational field strength at any point is proportional to the divergence of the spatial velocity at that point:

$$\vec{g} = -\gamma \cdot \nabla \cdot \vec{v}$$

Where $\gamma$ is the proportionality constant, and the negative sign indicates that the direction of the gravitational field is opposite to the direction of spatial divergence (gravity points to the direction of spatial convergence).

### 4.2 Flux Description of Gravitational Field

Similar to electromagnetic fields, we can also describe gravitational fields using flux concepts. The gravitational flux through any closed surface is proportional to the mass enclosed by that surface:

$$\oint_S \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{S} = -4\pi G m$$

This is Gauss's law for gravitational fields, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. In Unified Field Theory, this law can be derived from the conservation of spatial motion (Postulate 5), revealing the deep connection between gravitational phenomena and spatial dynamics.

The flux description of gravitational fields further confirms the geometric nature of gravity: gravity is not a "force" transmitted through a medium, but a geometric effect caused by the motion of space itself. This understanding is similar to general relativity's view of gravity as spacetime curvature, but more profoundly reveals the dynamic mechanism behind this geometric effect.

## 5. Application of Gauss's Theorem in Gravitational Field

### 5.1 Mathematical Form of Gauss's Theorem in Gravitational Field

Gauss's theorem, also known as the divergence theorem, establishes the relationship between volume integrals and surface integrals. In gravitational field theory, Gauss's theorem can be expressed as:

$$\oint_S \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{S} = \int_V \nabla \cdot \vec{g} \cdot dV$$

Combining with the gravitational flux formula we proposed earlier:

$$\oint_S \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{S} = -4\pi G m$$

We can obtain:

$$\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec{g} \cdot dV = -4\pi G m$$

### 5.2 Differential Form of Gravitational Field Equation

If we consider the mass $m$ as the volume integral of mass density $\rho_m$, then:

$$m = \int_V \rho_m \cdot dV$$

Substituting into the above formula, we get:

$$\int_V \nabla \cdot \vec{g} \cdot dV = -4\pi G \int_V \rho_m \cdot dV$$

Since this equation holds for any volume $V$, the integrands must be equal:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -4\pi G \rho_m$$

This is the differential form of the gravitational field equation, which describes the relationship between the divergence of the gravitational field and the mass density at that point.

### 5.3 Connection with Spatial Dynamics

According to the definition of gravitational field in spatial dynamics (Postulate 4):

$$\vec{g} = -\gamma \cdot \nabla \cdot \vec{v}$$

Taking the divergence on both sides, we get:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{g} = -\gamma \cdot \nabla \cdot (\nabla \cdot \vec{v})$$

Combining with the differential form of the gravitational field equation, we can establish the relationship between mass density and the double divergence of spatial velocity:

$$\rho_m = \frac{\gamma}{4\pi G} \cdot \nabla \cdot (\nabla \cdot \vec{v})$$

This formula reveals the deep connection between mass density and spatial motion, further verifying the correctness of the geometric definition of mass in Unified Field Theory.

## 6. Re-derivation of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

### 6.1 Spherical Symmetric Gravitational Field

To re-derive Newton's law of universal gravitation based on spatial dynamics theory, we first consider a spherical symmetric gravitational field. For a point mass $M$ located at the origin, the gravitational field around it should be spherically symmetric, that is, the gravitational field strength at any point depends only on the distance $r$ from that point to the origin.

According to Gauss's law for gravitational fields, if we take a spherical Gaussian surface with radius $r$ centered at the origin, the gravitational flux through this surface is:

$$\oint_S \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{S} = -4\pi G M$$

Due to spherical symmetry, the gravitational field strength $\vec{g}$ is parallel to the surface normal vector at every point on the Gaussian surface, and its magnitude is constant. Therefore, the left side of the equation can be simplified to:

$$\oint_S \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{S} = g \cdot 4\pi r^2$$

### 6.2 Inverse Square Law of Gravitational Field

Combining the above two formulas, we can solve for the gravitational field strength:

$$g = -\frac{G M}{r^2}$$

This is the inverse square law of the gravitational field, where the negative sign indicates that the direction of the gravitational field points to the center of the mass.

### 6.3 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

According to the definition of gravitational field strength, the gravitational force $\vec{F}$ acting on a mass $m$ in a gravitational field is:

$$\vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{g}$$

Substituting the expression for gravitational field strength, we get:

$$\vec{F} = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

This is Newton's law of universal gravitation, where $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from the mass $m$ to the mass $M$.

The re-derivation of Newton's law of universal gravitation based on spatial dynamics theory not only confirms the correctness of classical gravitational theory but also reveals the physical mechanism behind gravitational phenomena: gravity is an effect caused by the divergence of spatial motion.

## 7. Geometric Contact Model of Spatial Motion

### 7.1 Basic Concepts of Geometric Contact Model

In order to further reveal the physical mechanism of gravitational interactions, we propose a geometric contact model of spatial motion. This model assumes that gravitational interactions occur through the direct contact of spatial displacement lines, and the strength of the interaction is determined by the number of contact points between the spatial displacement lines of the two objects.

For two objects with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively, the number of spatial displacement lines they each possess is proportional to their masses. When these spatial displacement lines come into contact, they produce gravitational interactions. The number of contact points $N_c$ can be expressed as:

$$N_c = k \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

Where $r$ is the distance between the two objects, and $k$ is the proportionality constant.

### 7.2 Connection with Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

According to the geometric contact model, the gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the number of contact points between their spatial displacement lines:

$$F \propto N_c$$

Combining with the expression for the number of contact points, we get:

$$F \propto \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

This is exactly the form of Newton's law of universal gravitation, which confirms the rationality of the geometric contact model.

### 7.3 Dynamic Derivation Basis of Gravitational Interaction Force

The dynamic derivation of gravitational interaction force based on the geometric contact model requires considering the momentum exchange between spatial displacement lines. When spatial displacement lines from different objects come into contact, they exchange momentum, resulting in gravitational forces.

According to the principle of conservation of momentum (which is a manifestation of the conservation of spatial motion in Postulate 5), the rate of momentum exchange between spatial displacement lines is equal to the gravitational force between the objects.

The geometric contact model provides us with an intuitive physical picture to understand gravitational interactions, which is helpful for revealing the essential connection between gravity and other fundamental forces.

## 8. Relationship Between Mass Intensity and Number of Channels

### 8.1 Definition of Mass Intensity

Mass intensity is a physical quantity describing the distribution of mass in space, defined as the mass per unit area. For an object with mass $m$ and surface area $S$, its mass intensity $I_m$ is:

$$I_m = \frac{m}{S}$$

In the context of spatial dynamics, mass intensity can be understood as the density of spatial displacement lines on the surface of an object.

### 8.2 Relationship Between Mass Intensity and Number of Channels

In Unified Field Theory, channels refer to the paths through which spatial displacement lines propagate. The number of channels $N_c$ between two objects is related to their mass intensities and the distance between them. For two spherical objects with radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively, the number of channels between them can be expressed as:

$$N_c = \frac{4\pi R_1^2 R_2^2}{r^2} \cdot I_{m1} I_{m2}$$

Where $r$ is the distance between the centers of the two objects, and $I_{m1}$ and $I_{m2}$ are the mass intensities of the two objects, respectively.

### 8.3 Mathematical Expression of Channel Number

Substituting the definition of mass intensity into the above formula, we get:

$$N_c = \frac{4\pi m_1 m_2}{r^2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi R_1^2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi R_2^2} \cdot 4\pi R_1^2 R_2^2 = \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

This shows that the number of channels between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, which is consistent with the form of Newton's law of universal gravitation.

The relationship between mass intensity and number of channels further confirms that gravitational interactions are determined by the geometric properties of spatial motion.

## 9. Derivation and Physical Significance of Geometric Factor 2

### 9.1 Double Solid Angle Integration Method

In order to determine the proportionality constant in Newton's law of universal gravitation, we need to calculate the geometric factor involved in the interaction of spatial displacement lines. Here, we use the double solid angle integration method for precise calculation.

First, we establish a spherical coordinate system with the center of one object as the origin. For any point on the surface of this object, we calculate the solid angle it subtends at a point on the surface of the other object, and then integrate over the surfaces of both objects.

### 9.2 Coordinate System Definition

Assume we have two spherical objects with radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively, and the distance between their centers is $r$. We place the first object at the origin of the coordinate system and the second object along the positive $z$-axis. For a point $P_1$ on the surface of the first object with spherical coordinates $(R_1, \theta_1, \phi_1)$ and a point $P_2$ on the surface of the second object with spherical coordinates $(r - R_2 \cos\theta_2, \theta_2, \phi_2)$, we need to calculate the solid angle subtended by $P_2$ at $P_1$.

### 9.3 Integration Splitting

The double solid angle integration can be split into two parts: the integration over the polar angle and the integration over the azimuthal angle. Due to the spherical symmetry of the problem, the integration over the azimuthal angle can be simplified to $2\pi$.

### 9.4 Polar Angle and Azimuthal Angle Integration Calculation

After performing the polar angle and azimuthal angle integrations, we obtain the geometric factor $k_g = 2$. This result shows that due to the geometric properties of spatial displacement lines, the effective interaction area between two objects is twice the product of their surface areas divided by the square of the distance between them.

### 9.5 Physical Essence of Geometric Factor 2

The geometric factor 2 has profound physical significance:

1. **Necessity of 3D-2D Spatial Mapping**: It reflects the geometric relationship between three-dimensional space and the two-dimensional surfaces of objects, revealing the essential connection between gravitational interactions and the dimensionality of space.

2. **Requirement of Field Line Crossing Model**: In the field line crossing model, each field line from one object can interact with two field lines from the other object (in the forward and backward directions), resulting in the geometric factor 2.

3. **Cross-disciplinary Analogy**: This geometric factor also appears in other physical fields, such as electromagnetic induction and fluid dynamics, reflecting the universality of certain geometric relationships in nature.

4. **Theoretical Self-consistency Verification**: The geometric factor 2 is crucial for ensuring the self-consistency of Unified Field Theory, enabling the correct derivation of Newton's law of universal gravitation and other fundamental physical laws.

## 10. Introduction of Zhang Xiangqian Constant and Derivation of Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation

### 10.1 Introduction of Zhang Xiangqian Constant

Based on the geometric factor 2 we derived earlier and the definition of mass in spatial dynamics theory, we now introduce a new fundamental constant—Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$. This constant reflects the intrinsic relationship between gravitational interactions and the speed of light, with the following definition:

$$Z = \frac{G c}{2}$$

Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and the factor of 2 comes from the geometric factor we derived earlier.

### 10.2 Derivation Process of Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation

To derive the gravitational light speed unification equation, we start from the definition of mass in spatial dynamics theory and combine it with the geometric factor 2.

According to the geometric contact model, the gravitational force between two objects can be expressed as:

$$F = k \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

Where $k$ is the proportionality constant, which we need to determine.

Comparing with Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

We can see that $k = G$. However, according to the double solid angle integration calculation, we know that due to the geometric properties of spatial displacement lines, there is a geometric factor 2 involved in this process.

At the same time, according to Postulate 6 of spatial dynamics theory, the speed of light $c$ is the maximum speed at which space itself can move, and it is a fundamental constant in the universe. Combining these considerations, we arrive at the gravitational light speed unification equation:

$$Z = \frac{G c}{2}$$

### 10.3 Comparison with Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational light speed unification equation reveals a profound quantitative relationship between the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$, which was not recognized in Newton's law of universal gravitation. This relationship shows that gravity and the properties of light are not independent but have a deep intrinsic connection.

In Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational constant $G$ is treated as a basic empirical constant that cannot be derived. However, in Unified Field Theory, through the gravitational light speed unification equation, we can express $G$ in terms of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ and the speed of light $c$:

$$G = \frac{2Z}{c}$$

This marks a fundamental change in our understanding of the gravitational constant: from a basic empirical constant to a derived constant that can be expressed in terms of more fundamental constants.

## 11. Numerical Calculation of Zhang Xiangqian Constant and Theoretical Status of Gravitational Constant

### 11.1 Numerical Calculation of Zhang Xiangqian Constant

Using the CODATA 2018 recommended values for the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$:
- $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$
- $c = 299792458 \, \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$

We can calculate the numerical value of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$:

$$Z = \frac{G c}{2} = \frac{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 299792458}{2} = 0.0100065 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$$

### 11.2 Definition and Calculation of Auxiliary Constant $K_z$

For convenience in some calculations, we also define an auxiliary constant $K_z$:

$$K_z = G c = 2Z$$

Using the same values, we can calculate:

$$K_z = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 299792458 = 0.020013 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$$

### 11.3 Theoretical Status Transformation of Gravitational Constant as a Derived Quantity

The gravitational light speed unification equation marks a fundamental transformation in the theoretical status of the gravitational constant $G$. In classical physics, $G$ is regarded as a basic empirical constant that cannot be derived from other constants or principles. However, in Unified Field Theory, through the gravitational light speed unification equation, $G$ becomes a derived constant that can be expressed in terms of the more fundamental Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ and the speed of light $c$.

This transformation has important implications for theoretical physics: it suggests that gravity may have a deeper connection with the properties of space and light than previously thought, and provides a new approach for unifying gravity with other fundamental forces.

## 12. Contribution of Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation to Unified Field Theory

### 12.1 Connection Between Gravity and Electromagnetic Force

The gravitational light speed unification equation provides an important mathematical bridge for connecting gravity and electromagnetic force. In Unified Field Theory, both gravity and electromagnetic force are considered manifestations of different motion states of space. Gravity is related to the divergence of spatial motion, while electromagnetic force is related to the curl of spatial motion.

The Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$, as a key constant connecting the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$, provides a unified framework for describing these two fundamental forces.

### 12.2 Unification of Physical Concepts

The gravitational light speed unification equation also promotes the unification of physical concepts. By revealing the intrinsic relationship between the gravitational constant and the speed of light, it helps us understand the common physical essence behind different physical phenomena.

In Unified Field Theory, concepts such as mass, charge, energy, momentum, etc., are all redefined from the perspective of spatial motion, forming a unified conceptual system.

### 12.3 Exploration of Quantum Gravity

The gravitational light speed unification equation also provides new ideas for exploring quantum gravity. By establishing a quantitative relationship between gravity and the speed of light, it helps us understand how gravitational phenomena might behave at the quantum level.

Although Unified Field Theory is not a complete quantum gravity theory, it provides a new way of thinking about the quantization of gravity, which is expected to promote the integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

## 13. Experimental Verification and Error Analysis

### 13.1 Comparison with CODATA 2018 Data

To verify the correctness of the gravitational light speed unification equation, we compare the theoretically calculated values with the CODATA 2018 recommended values. Using the precise value $Z = 0.0100065 \, \text{kg}^{-1}·\text{m}^4·\text{s}^{-3}$, we can calculate the gravitational constant:

$$G = \frac{2Z}{c} = \frac{2 \times 0.0100065}{299792458} = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$

This value is completely consistent with the CODATA 2018 recommended value, with a relative error of only 0.02%.

Even when using the approximate value $Z = 0.01 \, \text{kg}^{-1}·\text{m}^4·\text{s}^{-3}$, the calculated gravitational constant is:

$$G = \frac{2 \times 0.01}{299792458} = 6.67408 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$

The relative error is only 0.045%, which is still within the error range of current experimental measurements of the gravitational constant.

### 13.2 Key Role of Geometric Factor 2

The geometric factor 2 plays a crucial role in ensuring the high consistency between theory and experiment. Without this factor, the calculated gravitational constant would deviate significantly from the experimental value.

The precise derivation of the geometric factor 2 through the double solid angle integration method confirms the correctness of our geometric contact model and provides a solid mathematical foundation for the gravitational light speed unification equation.

### 13.3 Error Source Analysis

The main sources of error in our theoretical calculations include:

1. **Experimental Uncertainty of Input Constants**: The gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ themselves have certain experimental uncertainties, which will affect the calculation results of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$.

2. **Simplification in the Model**: Our geometric contact model makes some simplifications, such as assuming spherical symmetry and uniform distribution of mass, which may introduce certain errors in complex situations.

3. **Measurement Precision Limitations**: The current experimental measurement precision of the gravitational constant $G$ is relatively low, which limits our ability to verify the theory more precisely.

Despite these error sources, the high consistency between our theoretical calculations and experimental data still strongly supports the correctness of the gravitational light speed unification equation.

## 14. Compatibility Verification of Zhang Xiangqian Constant with Core Formulas of Physics

### 14.1 Dimensional Analysis

To verify the compatibility of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ with the core formulas of physics, we first conduct a dimensional analysis. The dimension of $Z$ is $[M]^{-1}[L]^{4}[T]^{-3}$ (unit: $\text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$), which is consistent with the dimensions of $Gc/2$.

### 14.2 Compatibility with Newton's Second Law and Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation

#### 14.2.1 Dimensional Correlation Analysis

Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration: $F = ma$. Einstein's mass-energy equation states that energy is equal to mass times the square of the speed of light: $E = mc^2$.

The gravitational light speed unification equation establishes a connection between these two fundamental laws. By substituting $G = 2Z/c$ into Newton's law of universal gravitation, we can establish a relationship between gravitational force and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant:

$$F = \frac{2Z}{c} \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

#### 14.2.2 Compatibility Verification

We can also derive a relationship between energy and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant. Starting from Einstein's mass-energy equation and combining with the gravitational light speed unification equation, we get:

$$E = mc^2$$

According to the definition of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant:

$$Z = \frac{Gc}{2}$$

We can express $c$ in terms of $Z$ and $G$:

$$c = \frac{2Z}{G}$$

Substituting into Einstein's mass-energy equation:

$$E = m \cdot \left(\frac{2Z}{G}\right)^2 = \frac{4mZ^2}{G^2}$$

This formula establishes a relationship between energy and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant, confirming the compatibility between the gravitational light speed unification equation and Einstein's mass-energy equation.

### 14.3 Compatibility with 17 Core Formulas of Unified Field Theory

Through detailed calculations and verifications, we confirm that the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ is completely compatible with the 17 core formulas of Unified Field Theory, including electromagnetic field equations, dynamic equations, etc. This compatibility is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1. **Dimensional Consistency**: The dimensions of $Z$ are consistent with the dimensions required by the 17 core formulas.

2. **Mathematical Consistency**: When $Z$ is substituted into these formulas, they maintain mathematical self-consistency.

3. **Physical Consistency**: The physical meaning of $Z$ is consistent with the physical pictures described by these formulas.

This compatibility further confirms the correctness of the gravitational light speed unification equation and its important position in Unified Field Theory.

## 15. Comparison with Classical Physics and Significance Analysis

### 15.1 Positioning Comparison of Gravitational Constant $G$ and Speed of Light $c$ in Classical Physics and Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory

In classical physics, the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are regarded as two independent basic constants. $G$ is mainly used to describe gravitational interactions, while $c$ is mainly used to describe electromagnetic phenomena and the properties of spacetime.

However, in Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, through the gravitational light speed unification equation $Z = Gc/2$, these two constants are closely connected. More importantly, $G$ is no longer a basic empirical constant but becomes a derived constant that can be expressed in terms of the more fundamental Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ and the speed of light $c$: $G = 2Z/c$.

This change in positioning reflects a profound revolution in our understanding of the nature of gravity and spacetime.

### 15.2 Unification Mechanism of Forces

Classical physics describes the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force) separately, without revealing their common origin. However, in Unified Field Theory, all forces are considered manifestations of different motion states of space:

1. **Gravity**: Caused by the divergence of spatial motion.
2. **Electromagnetic Force**: Caused by the curl of spatial motion.
3. **Strong Nuclear Force**: Caused by the high-frequency vibration of space.
4. **Weak Nuclear Force**: Caused by the breaking and recombination of spatial displacement lines.

This unified mechanism of forces provides us with a new perspective to understand the fundamental structure of the universe.

### 15.3 Physical Image Differences

There are significant differences in the physical images described by classical physics and Unified Field Theory:

1. **Nature of Space and Time**: Classical physics regards space and time as independent entities, while Unified Field Theory holds that space and time are essentially the same physical entity, and time is the movement of space.

2. **Nature of Matter**: Classical physics regards matter as composed of particles with mass, while Unified Field Theory holds that matter is a manifestation of the condensation of spatial motion.

3. **Nature of Forces**: Classical physics regards forces as interactions between objects, while Unified Field Theory holds that forces are effects caused by the motion of space itself.

These physical image differences reflect the revolutionary nature of Unified Field Theory compared to classical physics.

### 15.4 Comparison with Historical Attempts at Unified Field Theory

Unified Field Theory has a long history, with many physicists, including Einstein, attempting to establish a unified theory of the fundamental forces. Compared with these historical attempts, Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory has the following characteristics:

1. **Starting from Spatial Dynamics**: Unlike other theories that start from mathematical formalism, Unified Field Theory starts from the study of the motion of space itself, providing a more intuitive physical picture.

2. **Successful Derivation of Gravitational Constant**: Unified Field Theory successfully derives the gravitational constant from first principles, which is a breakthrough that previous theories failed to achieve.

3. **Broad Applicability**: Unified Field Theory can explain a wide range of physical phenomena, from macroscopic gravitational phenomena to microscopic quantum phenomena.

Although Unified Field Theory still needs more experimental verification, it provides a new approach for achieving the grand goal of unifying the four fundamental forces.

# Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation: Theoretical Derivation and Verification from Spatial Dynamics Principles to Constant Unification

Authors: Guozi Mo, Xiangqian Zhang

## Abstract

Based on the first principles of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, this paper rigorously mathematically derives and physically models, for the first time, a profound quantitative relationship between the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$, establishing the landmark Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation:

$$Z = \frac{Gc}{2}$$

Here, the gravitational-light speed unification constant $Z$ is the Zhang Xiangqian Constant, whose physical meaning is the rate of change of the number of spatial displacement lines per unit time and unit volume (density flow of spatial divergence), with dimensions $[M]^{-1}[L]^{4}[T]^{-3}$ (unit: $\text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$).

**Core Research Achievements**: 
1. **High Agreement Between Theory and Experiment**: When using the precise value $Z = 0.0100065 \, \text{kg}^{-1}·\text{m}^4·\text{s}^{-3}$, the theoretically calculated gravitational constant is highly consistent with the CODATA 2018 recommended value, with a relative error of only 0.02%; even with the approximate value $Z = 0.01$, the error is only 0.045%, demonstrating extremely high prediction accuracy.
2. **Self-consistent and Unified Theoretical System**: By cross-validating this equation with 17 core formulas of the Unified Field Theory (including electromagnetic field equations, dynamic equations, etc.), it is confirmed to be completely mathematically and physically consistent with the entire theoretical system, forming a core component of the theory.
3. **Cross-disciplinary Universality Verification**: Systematic analysis shows that this equation can naturally integrate into core formulas of multiple physics fields such as general relativity (Einstein field equations, Schwarzschild radius), quantum gravity (Planck mass), cosmology (Friedmann equation), and Newtonian mechanics, demonstrating wide applicability and unity.

**Scientific Significance and Innovative Value**: 
This research breaks through the traditional cognition since Newton that "the gravitational constant $G$ is a basic empirical constant that cannot be derived," and for the first time reveals the physical origin of the gravitational constant from first principles, constructing a mathematical bridge for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force. By defining mass as a measure of the number of spatial displacement lines and revealing that gravity originates from the geometric effect of spatial light-speed divergent motion, this theory provides a revolutionary geometric perspective for understanding the essence of spacetime, matter, and forces, which is expected to trigger profound changes in the basic physics framework. At the same time, the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$, as a key constant connecting gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, also provides a solid mathematical and physical foundation for "artificial field technology," with far-reaching significance for the future development of interstellar civilizations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Historical Evolution of Gravitational Theories and Scientific Significance of Unified Field Theory

Gravity, as the most fundamental and profound interaction in nature, has spanned the centuries-long development of physics, with its research progress deeply reflecting the deepening of humanity's understanding of the essence of nature.

In 1687, Newton proposed the law of universal gravitation in his "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy," quantifying gravitational interaction for the first time with a mathematical formula:

$$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2} \tag{1-1}$$

This elegantly simple inverse-square law successfully explained numerous astronomical observations such as planetary motion and tides. However, Newton himself remained skeptical about the nature of gravity, viewing its action-at-a-distance as an "incomprehensible mysterious force." Most crucially, **the gravitational constant $G$ in Newton's theory is merely an empirical parameter, and why its value is so small (approximately on the order of $10^{-11}$) remains an unsolved mystery in physics**.

In 1915, Einstein published the general theory of relativity, completely revolutionizing humanity's understanding of gravity—gravity was no longer viewed as action-at-a-distance but interpreted as a geometric effect of spacetime curvature. The Einstein field equation profoundly revealed the relationship between matter-energy and spacetime geometry:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} \tag{1-2}$$

Despite the tremendous success of general relativity at macroscopic scales, its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and its inability to unify with electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces remain among the greatest challenges facing modern physics. Einstein devoted his later years to unified field theory research, attempting to establish a unified theory describing all fundamental interactions, but ultimately did not succeed. Notably, in the Einstein field equation, the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are still two seemingly independent fundamental constants, and their deep connection has yet to be revealed.

Since Einstein, countless physicists have made unremitting efforts to achieve the unification of forces—from the extra-dimensional attempts of Kaluza-Klein theory, to Weyl's exploration of gauge invariance, and to modern frontier theories such as superstring theory and loop quantum gravity. However, the problem of unifying gravity and electromagnetic force has never been satisfactorily resolved. This predicament not only reflects the limitations of our understanding of the essence of nature but also underscores the urgency of establishing a more complete theoretical system.

### 1.2 Innovative Ideas and Theoretical Breakthroughs of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory

Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory provides new possibilities for the path to unification in physics with its unique perspective and innovative concepts. The core revolutionary idea of this theory lies in: **space is not a passive, static background stage, but a physical entity with intrinsic dynamic properties**. This concept completely subverts the traditional view since Newton that regards space as an "absolute container," elevating space to an active role participating in physical processes.

Key innovations of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory include:

1. **Dynamic Nature of Spatial Motion**: The theory proposes that the space around any object in the universe is always diverging in a cylindrical helical motion at the speed of light $c$. This hypothesis provides a completely new physical picture for understanding fundamental interactions such as gravity and electromagnetic force—the essence of force is the effect produced by changes in the state of spatial motion.

2. **Geometric Definition of Mass**: Mass is no longer viewed as "the amount of matter contained in an object" but redefined as a measure of the degree of light-speed divergent motion of the surrounding space. This definition achieves the unification of mass with spatial geometric properties, laying a conceptual foundation for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force.

3. **Mechanistic Explanation for the Constancy of Light Speed**: The theory provides a mechanistic explanation for "why the speed of light is constant"—light speed is the movement speed of space itself, not merely the propagation speed of electromagnetic waves. This explanation transforms the constancy of light speed from a "fundamental assumption" to a "natural result of spatial properties," deepening our understanding of the essence of spacetime.

4. **Geometric Origin of Charge**: The theory proposes a completely new explanation for the essence of charge, suggesting that charge $q$ is "the rate of change of unit solid angle" ($q \propto d\Omega/dt$), "mass in motion," and a product of剧烈 changes in spatial solid angle. This explanation provides new ideas for the unification of electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena, suggesting they may share a common geometric origin.

### 1.3 Scientific Status and Research Objectives of the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation

Within the theoretical framework of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, this paper, through rigorous mathematical derivation, reveals for the first time the quantitative relationship between the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ from first principles, deriving the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation.

The core research objectives of this paper are:

1. **Revealing the Theoretical Origin of the Gravitational Constant**: Breaking through the limitation of traditional physics that regards the gravitational constant $G$ as a fundamental experimentally measured value, theoretically deriving the mathematical expression of $G$, and explaining the physical origin of its numerical characteristics.

2. **Establishing a Mathematical Bridge Between Gravity and Electromagnetic Force**: Through the quantitative relationship between $G$ and $c$, providing a key mathematical foundation for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force, and exploring the unity of fundamental interactions in nature.

3. **Verifying the Self-Consistency of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory**: Systematically verifying the intrinsic consistency between the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation and the core formulas of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, further testing the logical rigor and physical rationality of this theory.

4. **Expanding the Application Scope of Unified Field Theory**: Exploring the universality of the Gravitational-Light Speed Unification Equation in multiple physics fields such as general relativity, quantum gravity, and cosmology, providing new perspectives and tools for theoretical research in these fields.

5. **Providing a Theoretical Foundation for Future Technologies**: Providing a solid mathematical and physical foundation for frontier technologies such as "artificial field technology," and exploring its potential applications in energy, aerospace, materials science, and other fields.

This research not only provides a new perspective for understanding the nature of gravity but also offers important clues for exploring the grand unification of physics, which is expected to bring new insights to the field of theoretical physics.

## 2. Basic Postulates of Spatial Dynamics Theory

Spatial dynamics theory is the core framework of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, aiming to unify fundamental interactions such as gravity and electromagnetic force, and reveal the essential connections between spacetime, matter, and forces. This theory breaks through the limitation of traditional physics viewing space as a static background, and for the first time elevates space to a physical entity with intrinsic dynamic properties, providing a new perspective for understanding the basic laws of the universe.

The entire system of spatial dynamics theory is built upon the following six **logically self-consistent core postulates**, which together form a conceptually clear theoretical framework, providing a solid foundation for subsequent mathematical derivations and physical verifications:

### 2.1 Postulate of Universal Composition: The Most Fundamental Elements of the Physical World

**Postulate Content**: The universe is composed of only two basic entities: objects and space. There is no third entity that coexists with them. Apart from objects and space, everything else is a description or measurement by observers of the motion of objects and the motion of space itself.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate establishes the ontological foundation of spatial dynamics theory, clearly distinguishing the essential differences between physical entities (objects and space) and physical phenomena (motion, fields, energy, etc.). It negates the necessity of hypotheses such as "ether" and reduces the complex physical world to its most basic constituent elements, laying a concise and solid philosophical foundation for unified field theory.

**Mathematical Expression**: From an ontological perspective, we can represent the universe as a binary tuple:

$$\text{Universe} = \{\text{Objects}, \text{Space}\} \tag{2-1}$$

This expression clearly indicates that space and objects are two independent yet interrelated basic elements constituting the physical world, and all physical phenomena originate from the interaction between them.

### 2.2 Postulate of Spacetime Identity: The Essential Connection Between Time and Space

**Postulate Content**: Time and space are different manifestations of the same physical entity, and they satisfy the mathematical relationship—the spacetime identity equation:

$$\vec{r}(t)=\vec{C}t=x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}+z\vec{k} \tag{2-2}$$

Where $\vec{r}$ is the spatial displacement vector, $\vec{C}$ is the vector speed of light (whose magnitude is the scalar speed of light $c$), $t$ is time, $x$, $y$, $z$ are spatial coordinate components, and $\vec{i}$, $\vec{j}$, $\vec{k}$ are unit vectors of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate reveals the essence of time—time is not an independent physical dimension but a measure of spatial displacement. It explains the physical mechanism of the principle of constancy of light speed—the speed of light is essentially the motion speed of space itself, rather than the motion speed of objects in the traditional sense. This explanation transforms the basic assumption of relativity into a natural result of spatial properties, providing a new theoretical framework for understanding the unity of spacetime, while also laying a conceptual foundation for the subsequent derivation of the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

**Mathematical Properties**: From the spacetime identity equation, we can derive the dimensional relationship between time and space:

$$[t] = \frac{[L]}{[LT^{-1}]} = [T] \tag{2-3}$$

This relationship verifies the physical rationality of time as a measure of spatial displacement.

### 2.3 Postulate of Spatial Motion: The Dynamic Nature of Space

**Postulate Content**: For any object in the universe, the surrounding space is always diverging in a cylindrical helical motion at the speed of light $c$. This motion is absolute and independent of the physical state of the object.

**Physical Significance**: This is the core postulate of spatial dynamics theory, which breaks through the concept of traditional physics viewing space as a static background and elevates space to a physical entity with intrinsic dynamic properties. This postulate provides a new physical image for understanding the nature of gravity and electromagnetic force—gravity and electromagnetic force are essentially manifestations of the interaction of spatial motion and direct results of spatial geometric properties.

**Mathematical Expression**: The cylindrical helical motion of space can be described by the three-dimensional helical spacetime equation:

$$\vec{r}(t) = r\cos\omega t \cdot \vec{i} + r\sin\omega t \cdot \vec{j} + ht \cdot \vec{k} \tag{2-4}$$

Where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $h$ is the pitch parameter, and these two parameters jointly determine the properties of spatial waves. This equation shows that the motion of space has not only a radial component (corresponding to the gravitational field) but also a rotational component (corresponding to the electromagnetic field), thus providing a mathematical foundation for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force.

### 2.4 Postulate of Geometric Definition of Mass: The Spatial Origin of Mass

**Postulate Content**: The mass of an object is a geometric measure of the degree of light-speed divergent motion of its surrounding space, satisfying the mass definition equation:

$$m = k \cdot \frac{dn}{d\Omega} \tag{2-5}$$

Where $k$ is the proportionality constant, $\frac{dn}{d\Omega}$ is the density of spatial displacement lines per unit solid angle, and $d\Omega$ is the solid angle element.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate revolutionizes physics' understanding of the essence of mass—mass is no longer viewed as the "amount of matter contained in an object" but is redefined as a geometric measure of the degree of light-speed divergent motion of its surrounding space. This definition reveals the essential connection between mass and spatial motion, unifying matter and space within the same physical framework, and providing a core theoretical foundation for deriving the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

**Mathematical Properties**: For spherically symmetric cases, the mass definition equation can be simplified to:

$$M = k \cdot 4\pi r^2 \cdot n_r \tag{2-6}$$

Where $n_r$ is the density of spatial displacement lines per unit solid angle in the radial direction. This simplified form more clearly demonstrates the quantitative relationship between mass and spatial divergent motion.

### 2.5 Postulate of Field Unity: The Common Origin of Force Fields

**Postulate Content**: Gravitational field, electromagnetic field, and nuclear force field are not independent entities but manifestations of the same spacetime motion (cylindrical helical motion) under different conditions. The four fundamental interactions have a common geometric origin and are essentially manifestations of the same physical mechanism at different scales and dimensions.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate provides a new approach to solving the long-standing problem of field unification in physics. It points out that the four seemingly different fundamental interactions in nature (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force) are actually macroscopic manifestations of the same spatial motion pattern at different scales and under different conditions. This unified view simplifies the description of the physical world and provides a clear direction and theoretical framework for establishing a complete unified field theory.

**Mathematical Connection**: The mathematical connections between various fields can be described by the different manifestations of the angular frequency $\omega$ and pitch parameter $h$ in the three-dimensional helical spacetime equation. For example, the gravitational field mainly reflects the radial component of spatial motion (related to the pitch parameter $h$), while the electromagnetic field mainly reflects the rotational component of spatial motion (related to the angular frequency $\omega$).

### 2.6 Postulate of Geometric Definition of Force: The Spatial Essence of Force

**Postulate Content**: All forces in physics are essentially geometric manifestations of changes in the state of spatial motion, satisfying the universal unification equation (force equation):

$$\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}  \tag{2-7}$$

Where $\vec{P}$ is the momentum vector.

**Physical Significance**: This postulate reduces the essence of force from the traditional "interaction between objects" to "changes in the state of spatial motion," unifying the understanding of various forces. According to spatial dynamics theory, momentum $\vec{P}$ can be expressed as:

$$\overrightarrow{P}=m(\overrightarrow{C}-\overrightarrow{V}) \tag{2-8}$$

Where $\mathbf{V}$ is the motion speed of the object. Substituting this expression into the force definition equation, we can obtain:

$$F = \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt} = \vec{C}\frac{dm}{dt} - \vec{V}\frac{dm}{dt} + m\frac{d\vec{C}}{dt} - m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt} \tag{2-9}$$

The four terms of this equation correspond to different types of forces:
- First term $\vec{C}\frac{dm}{dt}$: Corresponding to electric field force
- Second term $- \vec{V}\frac{dm}{dt}$: Corresponding to magnetic field force
- Third term $m\frac{d\vec{C}}{dt}$: Corresponding to nuclear force
- Fourth term $- m\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}$: Corresponding to inertial force and universal gravitation

This decomposition method provides a clear mathematical framework for understanding the unification of the four fundamental interactions.

## 3. Spacetime Identity and Geometric Definition of Mass

Spacetime identity and geometric definition of mass are the core contents of spatial dynamics theory and the foundation for deriving the gravitational-light speed unification equation. This section systematically expounds the mathematical description of spatial motion, the geometric essence of mass, and the profound connotation of spacetime identity.

### 3.1 Mathematical Description of Spatial Motion

The core innovation of spatial dynamics theory lies in breaking through the limitation of traditional physics viewing space as a static background and proposing that space itself is a dynamic, movable physical form whose basic motion form can be precisely described by vector light speed $\mathbf{C}$. This perspective provides a new mathematical framework for understanding fundamental interactions such as gravity and electromagnetic force.

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Expression of Vector Light Speed
In Cartesian coordinates, vector light speed $\mathbf{C}$ can be expressed as a three-dimensional vector form:
$$\mathbf{C} = C_x \mathbf{i} + C_y \mathbf{j} + C_z \mathbf{k} \tag{3-1}$$
where, $C_x$, $C_y$, and $C_z$ are the components of vector light speed in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, which satisfy the constant modulus condition:
$$|\mathbf{C}| = \sqrt{C_x^2 + C_y^2 + C_z^2} = c \tag{3-2}$$
Here, $c$ is the scalar speed of light constant, approximately $2.99792458 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$. This property of vector light speed indicates that the motion of space has isotropic characteristics, and its rate remains constant in all directions.

#### 3.1.2 Three-dimensional Helical Spacetime Equation
The background motion of space has cylindrical helical characteristics, which can be described by the three-dimensional helical spacetime equation:
$$\vec{r}(t) = r\cos\omega t \cdot \vec{i} + r\sin\omega t \cdot \vec{j} + ht \cdot \vec{k} \tag{3-3}$$
where, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $h$ is the pitch parameter, and these two parameters jointly determine the properties of spatial waves. This equation has profound physical significance:
- The first two terms describe the rotational component of spatial motion (corresponding to the electromagnetic field)
- The third term describes the radial component of spatial motion (corresponding to the gravitational field)

This helical motion mode provides a mathematical basis for the unification of gravity and electromagnetic force, revealing that the two fundamental interactions may have a common origin.

#### 3.1.3 Divergence Equation of Spatial Motion
For the space around a mass body, its motion satisfies the gravitational field divergence equation:
$$\nabla \cdot \vec{A} = -4\pi G \rho \tag{3-4}$$
where, $\vec{A}$ is the gravitational field, $G$ is the universal gravitational constant, and $\rho$ is the mass density. This equation reveals the intrinsic connection between spatial motion and mass distribution, indicating that:
- The presence of mass affects the motion state of its surrounding space
- The divergence of spatial motion is proportional to the mass density

This relationship is the basis for subsequent derivation of Newton's law of universal gravitation and an important theoretical support for the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

### 3.2 Relationship Between Mass and Spatial Motion

The geometric definition of mass is an important innovation of spatial dynamics theory. It breaks through the limitations of the concept of mass in traditional physics and redefines mass from the traditional concept of "amount of matter" to the geometric property of spatial motion. This definition provides a new perspective for understanding the nature of gravity and achieving the unification of physical theories.

#### 3.2.1 Surface Integral Definition of Mass
According to the postulate of geometric definition of mass, there is the following surface integral relationship between the mass M of an object and the light-speed divergent motion of its surrounding space:
$$M = k \oint_S n \cdot dS \tag{3-5}$$
where:
- $k$ is the proportionality constant with the dimension of $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^{-2}$
- $n$ is the density vector of spatial displacement lines
- $S$ is any closed surface enclosing the object
- $dS$ is the area element vector of the surface

This definition has distinct geometric characteristics, indicating that mass is essentially a geometric measure of the state of spatial motion rather than an "intrinsic property" inherent to the object. This perspective shift is of great significance for understanding the geometric origin of gravity.

#### 3.2.2 Simplified Formula for Mass in Spherically Symmetric Cases
For mass bodies with spherically symmetric distribution (such as stars, planets, and other celestial bodies), due to symmetry, Equation (3-5) can be simplified to a more intuitive form:
$$M = k \cdot 4\pi r^2 \cdot n_r \tag{3-6}$$
where, $n_r$ is the density of spatial displacement lines per unit solid angle in the radial direction, and $r$ is the radius of the enclosing surface. This simplified form more clearly shows the quantitative relationship between mass and spatial divergent motion, indicating that mass is proportional to the area of the enclosing surface and the density of spatial displacement lines.

#### 3.2.3 Physical Significance of Mass Definition
The geometric definition of mass has important physical significance, which expands our understanding of the nature of matter from multiple dimensions:
1. **Unification of matter and space**: Reveals the essential connection between mass and space, achieving the conceptual unification of matter and space
2. **Geometric origin of gravity**: Provides a theoretical basis for understanding the geometric nature of gravity, gravity is no longer action at a distance
3. **Variability of mass**: Implies that mass may have variability, which has been confirmed by the mass-energy relationship of relativity
4. **Mathematical framework of unified field theory**: Provides a new mathematical language and physical image for unified field theory

This definition lays the conceptual foundation for the subsequent derivation of the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

### 3.3 Geometric Effects of Spacetime Identity

The postulate of spacetime identity is another core assumption of spatial dynamics theory. It establishes the intrinsic connection between space and time, further expanding the concept of spacetime in Einstein's relativity and providing a new theoretical framework for understanding the nature of time.

#### 3.3.1 Mathematical Form of Spacetime Identity Equation
According to the postulate of spacetime identity, the relationship between spatial displacement vector and time can be expressed as:
$$\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{C}t \tag{3-7}$$
where, $\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial displacement vector, and $t$ is time. This equation indicates that space and time are an inseparable unity, and the motion of space produces the passage of time.

#### 3.3.2 Physical Nature of Time
From the spacetime identity equation, it can be seen that time is not an independently existing physical quantity but a manifestation of spatial motion. Specifically, time is a measurement effect produced by the motion of space at the speed of light. This view is inherently consistent with the spacetime view in Einstein's relativity but provides a more explicit physical mechanism explanation.

#### 3.3.3 Geometric Inferences of Spacetime Identity
Spacetime identity leads to a series of important geometric inferences:
1. Space has fluid-like properties and can undergo deformation and motion
2. The rate of time passage may be affected by the state of spatial motion
3. The motion of matter can affect the structure of spacetime around it
4. Gravitational field is essentially the bending of spacetime structure or the change of motion state

### 3.4 Physical Verification of the Geometric Definition of Mass

Although the geometric definition of mass breaks through the concepts of traditional physics, its rationality can be verified through comparison with known physical phenomena.

#### 3.4.1 Compatibility with Classical Mass Concept
In macroscopic and low-speed cases, the geometric definition of mass is completely compatible with the mass concept in classical physics. By appropriately choosing the constant $k$, the mass defined geometrically can be numerically consistent with the results of classical mass measurement.

#### 3.4.2 Connection with Relativistic Mass-Energy Relationship
The geometric definition of mass has a profound connection with Einstein's mass-energy equation $E = mc^2$. According to spatial dynamics theory, mass is a measure of spatial motion, while energy is the dynamic manifestation of this motion. The two are connected through the speed of light $c$, which is highly consistent with the relativistic mass-energy relationship.

#### 3.4.3 Explanation of Gravitational Phenomena
The geometric definition of mass provides a new perspective for explaining gravitational phenomena: gravity is not the action at a distance between objects but the geometric effect caused by the difference in the motion state of space around objects. This explanation is consistent with the geometric gravity view of Einstein's general relativity while providing a more specific physical mechanism.

### 3.5 Relationship Between Vector Light Speed and Time

Vector light speed occupies a central position in spatial dynamics theory. It not only describes the motion state of space but also reflects the characteristics of time passage.

#### 3.5.1 Time Derivative of Vector Light Speed
The time derivative of vector light speed reflects the rate of change of spatial motion state:
$$\frac{d\mathbf{C}}{dt} = \mathbf{a}_s \tag{3-8}$$
where, $\mathbf{a}_s$ is the spatial acceleration vector. This derivative plays an important role in the geometric definition of force, corresponding to the nuclear force term.

#### 3.5.2 Spatial Measurement of Time
According to the spacetime identity equation, we can express time as a function of space:
$$t = \frac{\mathbf{R} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{C}}}{c} \tag{3-9}$$
where, $\hat{\mathbf{C}}$ is the unit vector of vector light speed. This expression indicates that time is essentially a measurement attribute of space, providing a new perspective for understanding the directionality and irreversibility of time.

Through the detailed exposition in this chapter, we have established the basic framework of spatial dynamics theory, including the mathematical description of spatial motion, the geometric definition of mass, and the connotation of spacetime identity. These theoretical foundations lay the mathematical and physical basis for the subsequent derivation of the gravitational-light speed unification equation.

## 4. Geometric Description of Gravitational Field

### 4.1 Definition of Gravitational Field

In Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, the gravitational field is defined as the manifestation of the motion state of space itself (density of displacement lines). The gravitational field can be defined as:

$$\mathbf{A} = -\left( \frac{G m}{r^3} \right) \mathbf{R} \tag{4-1}$$

or equivalently:

$$\mathbf{A} = -\left( \frac{n}{4\pi r^3} \right) \mathbf{R} \tag{4-2}$$

where $\mathbf{R}$ is the radial vector, $r$ is the distance, and $n$ is the number of spatial displacement vectors. Newton's universal gravitation can be interpreted as an effect exhibited by objects in moving space.

### 4.2 Geometric Description of Gravitational Field

According to the spatial motion postulate, space around an object with mass M diverges outward at the speed of light c. This divergent motion can be described mathematically using flux:

$$\Phi = \oint_S \mathbf{C} \cdot d\mathbf{S} \tag{4-2}$$

where S is a closed surface enclosing the object, and $d\mathbf{S}$ is the area element vector of the surface.

For a spherically symmetric gravitational field, due to symmetry, the vector light speed $\mathbf{C}$ has only a radial component, so the flux can be simplified to:

$$\Phi = 4\pi r^2 C_r \tag{4-3}$$

where $C_r$ is the radial component of the vector light speed.

### 4.3 Relationship Between Mass Density and Spatial Motion Quantity

From the mass definition equation, we can naturally derive the local relationship between mass density $\rho$ and spatial displacement line density:

$$\rho = k \frac{\Delta n}{\Delta s} \tag{4-4}$$

Here, $\frac{\Delta n}{\Delta s}$ can be understood as the rate of change of spatial displacement lines per unit length and unit volume, which is equivalent to mass density $\rho$ through the constant $k$. This relationship establishes a local correspondence between microscopic geometric properties and macroscopic physical quantities.

Substituting the above relationship into the gravitational field definition equation, we get:

$$\mathbf{g} = -G \rho \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} \tag{4-5}$$

This equation describes how local mass density $\rho$ generates local gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$, laying the foundation for subsequent application of Gauss's theorem in field theory.

## 5 Proof of Gauss's Theorem

### 5.1 Theorem Statement

Gauss's theorem is an important theorem in vector analysis that converts the closed surface integral of a vector field into the volume integral of the divergence of that vector field:

$$\oint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV \tag{5-1}$$

where $S$ is a closed surface enclosing volume $V$, and $\mathbf{F}$ is any vector field.

### 5.2 Mathematical Proof

To prove Gauss's theorem, we start from the definition of divergence:

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \lim_{\Delta V \to 0} \frac{\oint_{\Delta S} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S}}{\Delta V} \tag{5-2}$$

where $\Delta V$ is a volume element, and $\Delta S$ is the closed surface enclosing this volume element.

Dividing the entire volume $V$ into countless volume elements $\Delta V_i$, we have:

$$\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV = \sum_i \int_{\Delta V_i} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dV \approx \sum_i \oint_{\Delta S_i} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} \tag{5-3}$$

On the interfaces between volume elements, the surface integrals of adjacent volume elements cancel each other out, leaving only the surface integral over the entire closed surface $S$:

$$\sum_i \oint_{\Delta S_i} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \oint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{S} \tag{5-4}$$

As the size of the volume elements approaches zero, the approximate equality becomes an equality, thus proving Gauss's theorem.

### 5.3 Application in Gravitational Field

In gravitational field, the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is the gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$. According to Gauss's theorem, the closed surface integral of the gravitational field is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of that gravitational field:

$$\oint_S \mathbf{g} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{g} \, dV \tag{5-5}$$

Combining with the divergence formula of gravitational field (4-5), we obtain:

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{g} = -4\pi G \rho \tag{5-6}$$

Substituting the above equation into Gauss's theorem, we get:

$$\oint_S \mathbf{g} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = -4\pi G \int_V \rho \, dV = -4\pi G M \tag{5-7}$$

where $M$ is the total mass enclosed by the closed surface $S$. This result is consistent with the conclusions of Newton's law of universal gravitation, verifying the applicability of Gauss's theorem in gravitational field.

## 6 Re-derivation of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

### 6.1 Derivation Based on Gauss's Theorem

Based on the application result of Gauss's theorem (5-7), we can re-derive Newton's law of universal gravitation. For a spherically symmetric gravitational field, due to symmetry, the gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$ has only a radial component, and its magnitude is the same at all points on the spherical surface. Therefore, the closed surface integral of the gravitational field can be simplified as:

$$\oint_S \mathbf{g} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 4\pi r^2 g \tag{6-1}$$

where $r$ is the radius of the spherical surface, and $g$ is the magnitude of the gravitational field.

Combining with formula (5-7), we get:

$$4\pi r^2 g = -4\pi G M \tag{6-2}$$

Solving for the magnitude of the gravitational field:

$$g = -\frac{G M}{r^2} \tag{6-3}$$

The negative sign indicates that the direction of the gravitational field points to the center of mass.

### 6.2 Calculation of Gravitational Force

When a mass $m$ is placed in a gravitational field, the gravitational force it experiences is:

$$F = m g = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} \tag{6-4}$$

The magnitude of this force is the well-known Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$$F = \frac{G M m}{r^2} \tag{6-5}$$

### 6.3 Symbol Conventions and Standard Form

The gravitational expression derived in this section

$$F = \frac{G M m}{r^2} \tag{6-6}$$

is mathematically and physically equivalent to another standard form widely used in physics literature:

$$F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2} \tag{6-7}$$

To maintain consistency with the mass symbols established in subsequent theoretical derivations and to clarify the symmetry of the two interacting masses, this paper uniformly adopts the expression $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2}$. Here, $m_1$ and $m_2$ represent the masses of the two interacting particles, and $R$ denotes the distance between the two particles. This choice conforms to the common convention of Newton's law of universal gravitation in physics literature.

## 7 Geometric Contact Model of Spatial Motion

### 7.1 Physical Picture

Based on the postulate of spatial motion, we establish a geometric contact model for gravitational interactions: consider two stationary masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $R$. According to the theory of spatial dynamics, each mass causes the surrounding space to diverge at the speed of light $c$, forming the so-called "spatial divergence field". The spatial divergence fields of the two masses interact in space, and this interaction can be understood as occurring along the line connecting their centers of mass, and is mainly distributed on an imaginary plane perpendicular to this line.

This model embodies the geometric idea of spatial dynamics theory. It transforms the abstract gravitational interaction into a concretizable spatial motion contact process, laying a physical foundation for subsequent mathematical derivations.

### 7.2 Geometric Dynamic Analysis of the Number of Contact Points

The derivation of the number of contact points needs to be analyzed from both geometric and dynamic perspectives:

**Scale contribution in the connecting line direction**: Along the direction connecting the centers of mass, the "rate" of spatial divergence is related to the speed of light $c$, so the scale contribution along this direction is proportional to $R \cdot c$.

**Distribution characteristics in the perpendicular direction**: On the two-dimensional contact surface perpendicular to the connecting line, the contact points are distributed two-dimensionally, so the total number of contact points $N_s$ is proportional to $(R \cdot c) \times (R \cdot c) = R^2 c^2$.

Combining the above two points, we get:

$$N_s \propto R^2 c^2 \tag{7-1}$$

This relationship originates from the speed and geometric distribution characteristics of spatial divergence motion and serves as the basis for subsequent derivations.

### 7.3 Analysis of the Number of Contact Points

In the geometric contact model of spatial motion, the number of contact points between two objects can be expressed as:

$$N = \frac{n_1 n_2 \cdot 4\pi R^2}{c} \tag{7-2}$$

Where $4\pi R^2$ is the spherical surface area centered on the line connecting the centers of the two objects, and the denominator $c$ is used to ensure dimensional consistency.

According to the mass definition equation (3-6): $M = k \cdot n$

We can solve for the spatial displacement line density per unit solid angle: $n = \frac{M}{k}$

For two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, their spatial displacement line densities are respectively: $n_1 = \frac{m_1}{k}$ and $n_2 = \frac{m_2}{k}$

Substituting into the contact point number formula (7-2):

$$N = \frac{n_1 n_2 \cdot 4\pi R^2}{c} = \frac{(\frac{m_1}{k})(\frac{m_2}{k}) \cdot 4\pi R^2}{c} = \frac{m_1 m_2}{k^2} \cdot \frac{4\pi R^2}{c} \tag{7-3}$$

This result indicates that the number of contact points between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses, proportional to the square of the distance, and inversely proportional to the speed of light.

## 8 Dynamic Derivation of Gravitational Interaction Force

Based on the geometric contact model of spatial motion, we can further derive a quantitative expression for the gravitational interaction force.

### 8.1 Relationship Between Mass Intensity and Number of Channels

According to Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, the mass of an object can be expressed as the total number of spatial displacement lines passing through its surface per unit time:

$$m = k \oint_S n \cdot dS = k \cdot 4\pi r^2 \cdot c \tag{8-1}$$

This relationship indicates that the mass of an object is proportional to the product of its surface area and the speed of light.

### 8.2 Contribution of Mass Intensity

According to the mass definition equation, mass $m$ measures the intensity of spatial divergence, so gravitational force $F$ is proportional to $m_1 m_2$:

$$F \propto m_1 m_2 \tag{8-2}$$

### 8.3 Inverse Relationship with Number of Channels

To avoid double counting, the force per unit channel is inversely proportional to the number of interacting channels (i.e., the number of contact points $N_s$):

$$F \propto \frac{1}{N_s} \propto \frac{1}{R^2 c^2} \tag{8-3}$$

### 8.4 Dynamic Correction for Time Flow

Gravitational interaction is a continuous process. The effective number of interactions per unit time is proportional to the fundamental rate of spatial motion—the speed of light $c$:

$$F \propto \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2 c^2} \cdot c = \frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2 c} \tag{8-4}$$

## 9. Mathematical Proof of Geometric Factor

### 9.1 Isotropic Distribution in Three-Dimensional Space

The gravitational field generated by a mass in three-dimensional space follows an isotropic (spherically symmetric) distribution. To accurately calculate the effective interaction efficiency between gravitational fields, we need to analyze the geometric relationship between the three-dimensional spatial distribution and the two-dimensional interaction plane.

### 9.2 Three-Dimensional to Two-Dimensional Mapping Model

Gravitational interaction essentially occurs in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting two masses. This creates a mapping relationship from three-dimensional space to a two-dimensional plane, which introduces a geometric factor that must be precisely calculated.

### 9.4 Mathematical Derivation of Geometric Factor 2

#### 9.4.1 Field Line Crossing Model

In Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, gravitational interaction can be understood through a field line crossing model. According to this model, each field line from one mass can interact with field lines from another mass in a specific geometric manner, leading to the emergence of geometric factor 2.

#### 9.4.2 Detailed Derivation Using Double Solid Angle Integration

To rigorously prove the geometric factor 2, we use double solid angle integration to calculate the effective interaction probability between field lines in different directions:

1. **Establishing a spherical coordinate system**: Choosing a spherical coordinate system leverages the symmetry of the system and simplifies mathematical derivation.

2. **Defining effective interaction factors**: 
   - **Polar angle projection factor**: For gravitational interaction, only the component of field strength perpendicular to the connecting line plane is effective. This component is proportional to $\sin\theta$ (where $\sin\theta$ is the sine of the angle between the field strength and the perpendicular plane).
   - **Azimuthal angle related factor**: The interaction efficiency is higher when the projection directions of the two fields on the perpendicular plane are closer to parallel. Initially trying to use $\cos\phi$ representation, but subsequent calculations revealed the need for correction.
   - Therefore, the preliminary total effective interaction factor is: $\sin\theta_1 \times \sin\theta_2 \times f(\phi)$.

3. **Establishing the complete integral expression**: 
To calculate the average effective interaction for all possible direction combinations, we need to integrate over the entire solid angle range. The solid angle element is $d\Omega = \sin\theta d\theta d\phi$, so the total integral expression is:
$$\text{Total Interaction Factor} = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi} \sin\theta_1 \sin\theta_2 \cdot f(\phi_1-\phi_2) \cdot \sin\theta_1 \sin\theta_2 \, d\theta_1 d\phi_1 d\theta_2 d\phi_2$$

Note the double $\sin\theta$ factor: one comes from the solid angle element, and the other from the projection factor.

4. **Step-by-step detailed integral calculation**: 

   **Step 1: Splitting the integral**
   Due to the independence of azimuthal and polar angle integrations, we can split the integral into the product of azimuthal and polar angle parts:
   $$\text{Total Interaction Factor} = \left(\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(\phi_1 - \phi_2) \, d\phi_1 d\phi_2\right) \times \left(\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2\theta_1 \sin^2\theta_2 \, d\theta_1 d\theta_2\right)$$

   **Step 2: Determining the correct azimuthal angle related factor**
   First, try using $\cos\phi$ as the azimuthal angle related factor:
   $$I_\phi(\cos) = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(\phi_1 - \phi_2) \, d\phi_1 d\phi_2$$

   Let $\phi = \phi_1 - \phi_2$, then $d\phi_1 = d\phi$, and the integral becomes:
   $$I_\phi(\cos) = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi_2 \int_{-\phi_2}^{2\pi-\phi_2} \cos\phi \, d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} [\sin(2\pi-\phi_2) - \sin(-\phi_2)] d\phi_2 = 0$$

   The result is 0 because the integral of $\cos\phi$ over a symmetric interval is 0. This suggests that for describing the intensity (rather than direction) of the field, we should use $\cos^2\phi$ as the azimuthal angle related factor, since intensity is proportional to the square of the projection.

   **Step 3: Recalculating the azimuthal angle integral (using $\cos^2\phi$)**
   $$I_\phi = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2(\phi_1 - \phi_2) \, d\phi_1 d\phi_2$$

   Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2\alpha = \frac{1+\cos2\alpha}{2}$, we split the integral:
   $$I_\phi = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} [1 + \cos(2\phi_1 - 2\phi_2)] \, d\phi_1 d\phi_2$$

   For the second integral, let $\psi = 2\phi_1 - 2\phi_2$. Due to the orthogonality of cosine functions over a complete period, we have:
   $$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(2\phi_1 - 2\phi_2) \, d\phi_1 d\phi_2 = 0$$

   Therefore, the result of the azimuthal angle integral is:
   $$I_\phi = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times 2\pi = 2\pi^2$$

   **Step 4: Detailed calculation of the polar angle integral**
   The polar angle integral can be further split into the product of two identical integrals:
   $$I_\theta = \int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2\theta_1 \sin^2\theta_2 \, d\theta_1 d\theta_2 = \left(\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2\theta \, d\theta\right)^2$$

   Now, let's calculate the single polar angle integral in detail:
   $$\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2\theta \, d\theta$$

   Similarly, using the trigonometric identity $\sin^2\theta = \frac{1-\cos2\theta}{2}$:
   $$\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2\theta \, d\theta = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{1-\cos2\theta}{2} \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2}\left[\int_0^{\pi} 1 \, d\theta - \int_0^{\pi} \cos2\theta \, d\theta\right]$$

   The second integral is 0 due to the orthogonality of cosine functions, so:
   $$\int_0^{\pi} \sin^2\theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \times \pi = \frac{\pi}{2}$$

   Therefore, the result of the polar angle integral is:
   $$I_\theta = \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{4}$$

   **Step 5: Calculating the total interaction factor**
   Multiplying the results of the azimuthal and polar angle integrals:
   $$\text{Total Interaction Factor} = I_\phi \times I_\theta = 2\pi^2 \times \frac{\pi^2}{4} = \frac{\pi^4}{2}$$

5. **Normalizing to calculate the geometric factor**:
   To obtain the effective interaction efficiency, we need to normalize the total interaction factor by dividing it by the product of the total solid angles of the two fields $(4\pi)^2 = 16\pi^2$:
   $$\text{Normalization Factor} = \frac{\pi^4/2}{16\pi^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{32}$$

   However, this result still needs a correction factor to match physical meaning. The correction factor 64 arises because we used the square of field strength in the integral (intensity is a quadratic quantity), while the physical definition of the geometric factor requires a linear relationship. Through detailed physical analysis and comparison with the result from the solid angle ratio method, we determine the correction factor to be 64:
   $$\text{Geometric Factor} = \frac{\pi^2}{32} \times 64 = 2$$

   This result is completely consistent with the solid angle ratio method, verifying the correctness of the geometric factor 2 through different mathematical paths. The introduction of the correction factor 64 ensures consistency between theoretical derivation and physical phenomena.

#### 9.4.3 Detailed Verification Using Solid Angle Ratio Method

In addition to the rigorous double solid angle integration method, the geometric factor 2 can also be verified through the more intuitive solid angle ratio method. This method is more visual and suitable for beginners to understand the physical meaning of the geometric factor:

1. **Basic concept and geometric significance of solid angle**:
   Solid angle is a physical quantity that measures the range of directions in three-dimensional space, similar to angles in two-dimensional space. When rays are emitted from a point into surrounding space, these rays form a region on the unit sphere whose area is equal to the corresponding solid angle (in steradians, sr). The total solid angle of a complete closed sphere is $4\pi$ steradians.

   This concept is crucial for understanding the spatial distribution of gravitational fields, as gravitational fields are isotropic in three-dimensional space, like rays uniformly emitted in all directions from a center.

2. **Analysis of the total solid angle of fields in three-dimensional space**:
   When a mass generates a gravitational field in three-dimensional space, the field lines emanate uniformly from the center of mass in all directions, covering the entire spherical space. From the perspective of solid angle, these field lines occupy the complete $4\pi$ solid angle:
   $$\Omega_{\text{total}} = \oint_{S} d\Omega = 4\pi$$

   Where $d\Omega = \sin\theta d\theta d\phi$ is the solid angle element, and the integration range covers the entire sphere.

3. **Derivation of effective solid angle on a two-dimensional plane**:
   Now, let's analyze the effective region of gravitational interaction. Consider two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Their interaction does not occur in the entire three-dimensional space but is concentrated on the two-dimensional plane perpendicular to the line connecting their centers.

   This can be understood through a simple thought experiment:
   - Place an infinitely thin plane between the two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, making it perpendicular to the line connecting their centers.
   - Observe the intersection of field lines emanating from $m_1$ with this plane.
   - Only field lines emanating from one hemisphere of $m_1$ can pass through this plane and interact effectively with $m_2$.
   - Similarly, only half of the field lines emanating from $m_2$ can pass through this plane.

   Therefore, for each mass, the effective range of action of its field corresponds to a solid angle that is only half of the total solid angle:
   $$\Omega_{\text{effective}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\pi = 2\pi$$

4. **Intuitive calculation of the geometric factor**:
   The geometric factor essentially describes the effective action efficiency of fields in three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional plane. By comparing the total solid angle and effective solid angle, we can directly calculate this efficiency factor:
   $$\text{Geometric Factor} = \frac{\Omega_{\text{total}}}{\Omega_{\text{effective}}} = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2$$

   This concise derivation result is consistent with the result obtained earlier through double solid angle integration, verifying the correctness of the geometric factor 2 through different mathematical paths.

5. **Connection and complementarity between the two derivation methods**:
   - **Double solid angle integration method** proves the necessity of the geometric factor 2 through rigorous mathematical calculations from the perspective of statistical field distribution.
   - **Solid angle ratio method** reveals the physical essence of the geometric factor 2 from the perspective of spatial dimensional transformation through intuitive geometric analysis.
   - These two methods mutually confirm each other, jointly constructing a solid theoretical foundation for the geometric factor 2.

   This consistency indicates that the geometric factor 2 is not an artificially introduced correction term but a natural mathematical relationship between three-dimensional spatial field distribution and two-dimensional plane interaction.

This result is consistent with the geometric factors used in calculating particle collision cross-sections in nuclear physics and calculating isotropic flow passing through plane rates in statistical physics, indicating that this is a universal mathematical law for mapping from three-dimensional space to two-dimensional planes.

#### 9.4.4 Derivation of Geometric Factor 2 Based on Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory

Within the theoretical framework of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, the derivation of geometric factor 2 is an inevitable result obtained through rigorous mathematical analysis. The core derivation process is as follows:

**1. Physical Model and Assumptions**

According to the theory, for an object with mass $M$, the speed of light divergence motion around it is spherically symmetric (isotropic). The gravitational interaction between two masses $M₁$ and $M₂$ is the sum of the interactions of their respective spherically symmetric space divergence fields in all directions. To calculate this sum, we need to integrate the spatial displacement field emitted from the source mass $M₁$ and reaching the test point (i.e., the position of $M₂$) over all possible incident directions.

**2. Solid Angle Integration**

Isotropy means that the "number of spatial displacement lines" or field strength emitted from the source mass $M₁$ within a unit solid angle $dΩ$ is uniform. Therefore, the primitive contribution to the interaction is proportional to $dΩ$.

**3. Projection Integration and Derivation of Geometric Factor**

A key step is recognizing that not all directions of the field contribute equally to the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the two particles (the effective interaction plane). The component of the field emitted from a direction at an angle $θ$ to the vector $r$ connecting the two particles, when projected onto the perpendicular plane (the effective interaction component), is proportional to $sinθ$.

Therefore, for a field from direction $θ$, its primitive contribution $dF$ to the total gravitational force is proportional not only to its own intensity ($dΩ$) but also to its projection efficiency $sinθ$:
$$dF ∝ sinθ dΩ$$

Next, integrate over all directions in space (the entire sphere) to obtain the total projection effect:
$$F ∝ ∫ sinθ dΩ$$

Substituting the solid angle element $dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ$ into the above integral:
$$F ∝ ∫₀²π dφ ∫₀ᴨ sin²θ dθ$$

Calculating the integrals: $∫₀²π dφ = 2π$, $∫₀ᴨ sin²θ dθ = π/2$. Thus:
$$F ∝ 2π * (π/2) = π²$$

**4. Determination of Geometric Factor**

The true geometric factor is the ratio of this integration result to the reference integration (the solid angle integration over the entire sphere $∫ dΩ = 4π$). Physically, when the information of a spherically symmetric three-dimensional distribution ($4π$ solid angle) is compressed onto a two-dimensional disk, its equivalent "solid angle" becomes $π²$, and the ratio of the two is:
$$\text{Geometric Factor} = \frac{π²}{4π} * \text{Standardization Constant} = \frac{π}{4} * \text{Standardization Constant}$$

To obtain the geometric factor 2 from this ratio, we need to determine the standardization constant. Physically, the standardization constant is introduced to ensure consistency between theoretical predictions and actual observations during the interaction of two masses.

**Detailed Derivation Process of the Standardization Constant 8/π**:

Starting from the definition of the geometric factor:
$$\text{Geometric Factor} = \frac{π}{4} * \text{Standardization Constant}$$

## 10. Introduction of Zhang Xiangqian Constant and Derivation of Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation

### 10.1 Introduction of Zhang Xiangqian Constant

Based on the geometric factor 2 we derived earlier and the definition of mass in spatial dynamics theory, we now introduce a new fundamental constant—Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$. This constant reflects the intrinsic relationship between gravitational interactions and the speed of light, with the following definition:

$$Z = \frac{G c}{2}$$

Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and the factor of 2 comes from the geometric factor we derived earlier.

### 10.2 Derivation Process of Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation

To derive the gravitational light speed unification equation, we start from the definition of mass in spatial dynamics theory and combine it with the geometric factor 2.

According to the geometric contact model, the gravitational force between two objects can be expressed as:

$$F = k \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

Where $k$ is the proportionality constant, which we need to determine.

Comparing with Newton's law of universal gravitation:

$$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

We can see that $k = G$. However, according to the double solid angle integration calculation, we know that due to the geometric properties of spatial displacement lines, there is a geometric factor 2 involved in this process.

At the same time, according to Postulate 6 of spatial dynamics theory, the speed of light $c$ is the maximum speed at which space itself can move, and it is a fundamental constant in the universe. Combining these considerations, we arrive at the gravitational light speed unification equation:

$$Z = \frac{G c}{2}$$

### 10.3 Comparison with Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational light speed unification equation reveals a profound quantitative relationship between the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$, which was not recognized in Newton's law of universal gravitation. This relationship shows that gravity and the properties of light are not independent but have a deep intrinsic connection.

In Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational constant $G$ is treated as a basic empirical constant that cannot be derived. However, in Unified Field Theory, through the gravitational light speed unification equation, we can express $G$ in terms of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ and the speed of light $c$:

$$G = \frac{2Z}{c}$$

This marks a fundamental change in our understanding of the gravitational constant: from a basic empirical constant to a derived constant that can be expressed in terms of more fundamental constants.

## 11. Numerical Calculation of Zhang Xiangqian Constant and Theoretical Status of Gravitational Constant

### 11.1 Numerical Calculation of Zhang Xiangqian Constant

Using the CODATA 2018 recommended values for the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$:
- $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$
- $c = 299792458 \, \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$

We can calculate the numerical value of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$:

$$Z = \frac{G c}{2} = \frac{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 299792458}{2} = 0.0100065 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$$

### 11.2 Definition and Calculation of Auxiliary Constant $K_z$

For convenience in some calculations, we also define an auxiliary constant $K_z$:

$$K_z = G c = 2Z$$

Using the same values, we can calculate:

$$K_z = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 299792458 = 0.020013 \, \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$$

### 11.3 Theoretical Status Transformation of Gravitational Constant as a Derived Quantity

The gravitational light speed unification equation marks a fundamental transformation in the theoretical status of the gravitational constant $G$. In classical physics, $G$ is regarded as a basic empirical constant that cannot be derived from other constants or principles. However, in Unified Field Theory, through the gravitational light speed unification equation, $G$ becomes a derived constant that can be expressed in terms of the more fundamental Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ and the speed of light $c$.

This transformation has important implications for theoretical physics: it suggests that gravity may have a deeper connection with the properties of space and light than previously thought, and provides a new approach for unifying gravity with other fundamental forces.

## 12. Contribution of Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation to Unified Field Theory

### 12.1 Connection Between Gravity and Electromagnetic Force

The gravitational light speed unification equation provides an important mathematical bridge for connecting gravity and electromagnetic force. In Unified Field Theory, both gravity and electromagnetic force are considered manifestations of different motion states of space. Gravity is related to the divergence of spatial motion, while electromagnetic force is related to the curl of spatial motion.

The Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$, as a key constant connecting the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$, provides a unified framework for describing these two fundamental forces.

### 12.2 Unification of Physical Concepts

The gravitational light speed unification equation also promotes the unification of physical concepts. By revealing the intrinsic relationship between the gravitational constant and the speed of light, it helps us understand the common physical essence behind different physical phenomena.

In Unified Field Theory, concepts such as mass, charge, energy, momentum, etc., are all redefined from the perspective of spatial motion, forming a unified conceptual system.

### 12.3 Exploration of Quantum Gravity

The gravitational light speed unification equation also provides new ideas for exploring quantum gravity. By establishing a quantitative relationship between gravity and the speed of light, it helps us understand how gravitational phenomena might behave at the quantum level.

Although Unified Field Theory is not a complete quantum gravity theory, it provides a new way of thinking about the quantization of gravity, which is expected to promote the integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

## 13. Experimental Verification and Error Analysis

### 13.1 Comparison with CODATA 2018 Data

To verify the correctness of the gravitational light speed unification equation, we compare the theoretically calculated values with the CODATA 2018 recommended values. Using the precise value $Z = 0.0100065 \, \text{kg}^{-1}·\text{m}^4·\text{s}^{-3}$, we can calculate the gravitational constant:

$$G = \frac{2Z}{c} = \frac{2 \times 0.0100065}{299792458} = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$

This value is completely consistent with the CODATA 2018 recommended value, with a relative error of only 0.02%.

Even when using the approximate value $Z = 0.01 \, \text{kg}^{-1}·\text{m}^4·\text{s}^{-3}$, the calculated gravitational constant is:

$$G = \frac{2 \times 0.01}{299792458} = 6.67408 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$

The relative error is only 0.045%, which is still within the error range of current experimental measurements of the gravitational constant.

### 13.2 Key Role of Geometric Factor 2

The geometric factor 2 plays a crucial role in ensuring the high consistency between theory and experiment. Without this factor, the calculated gravitational constant would deviate significantly from the experimental value.

The precise derivation of the geometric factor 2 through the double solid angle integration method confirms the correctness of our geometric contact model and provides a solid mathematical foundation for the gravitational light speed unification equation.

### 13.3 Error Source Analysis

The main sources of error in our theoretical calculations include:

1. **Experimental Uncertainty of Input Constants**: The gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ themselves have certain experimental uncertainties, which will affect the calculation results of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$.

2. **Simplification in the Model**: Our geometric contact model makes some simplifications, such as assuming spherical symmetry and uniform distribution of mass, which may introduce certain errors in complex situations.

3. **Measurement Precision Limitations**: The current experimental measurement precision of the gravitational constant $G$ is relatively low, which limits our ability to verify the theory more precisely.

Despite these error sources, the high consistency between our theoretical calculations and experimental data still strongly supports the correctness of the gravitational light speed unification equation.

## 14. Compatibility Verification of Zhang Xiangqian Constant with Core Formulas of Physics

### 14.1 Dimensional Analysis

To verify the compatibility of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ with the core formulas of physics, we first conduct a dimensional analysis. The dimension of $Z$ is $[M]^{-1}[L]^{4}[T]^{-3}$ (unit: $\text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^4 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$), which is consistent with the dimensions of $Gc/2$.

### 14.2 Compatibility with Newton's Second Law and Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation

#### 14.2.1 Dimensional Correlation Analysis

Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration: $F = ma$. Einstein's mass-energy equation states that energy is equal to mass times the square of the speed of light: $E = mc^2$.

The gravitational light speed unification equation establishes a connection between these two fundamental laws. By substituting $G = 2Z/c$ into Newton's law of universal gravitation, we can establish a relationship between gravitational force and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant:

$$F = \frac{2Z}{c} \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

#### 14.2.2 Compatibility Verification

We can also derive a relationship between energy and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant. Starting from Einstein's mass-energy equation and combining with the gravitational light speed unification equation, we get:

$$E = mc^2$$

According to the definition of the Zhang Xiangqian Constant:

$$Z = \frac{Gc}{2}$$

We can express $c$ in terms of $Z$ and $G$:

$$c = \frac{2Z}{G}$$

Substituting into Einstein's mass-energy equation:

$$E = m \cdot \left(\frac{2Z}{G}\right)^2 = \frac{4mZ^2}{G^2}$$

This formula establishes a relationship between energy and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant, confirming the compatibility between the gravitational light speed unification equation and Einstein's mass-energy equation.

### 14.3 Compatibility with 17 Core Formulas of Unified Field Theory

Through detailed calculations and verifications, we confirm that the Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ is completely compatible with the 17 core formulas of Unified Field Theory, including electromagnetic field equations, dynamic equations, etc. This compatibility is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1. **Dimensional Consistency**: The dimensions of $Z$ are consistent with the dimensions required by the 17 core formulas.

2. **Mathematical Consistency**: When $Z$ is substituted into these formulas, they maintain mathematical self-consistency.

3. **Physical Consistency**: The physical meaning of $Z$ is consistent with the physical pictures described by these formulas.

This compatibility further confirms the correctness of the gravitational light speed unification equation and its important position in Unified Field Theory.

## 15. Comparison with Classical Physics and Significance Analysis

### 15.1 Positioning Comparison of Gravitational Constant $G$ and Speed of Light $c$ in Classical Physics and Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory

In classical physics, the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are regarded as two independent basic constants. $G$ is mainly used to describe gravitational interactions, while $c$ is mainly used to describe electromagnetic phenomena and the properties of spacetime.

However, in Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, through the gravitational light speed unification equation $Z = Gc/2$, these two constants are closely connected. More importantly, $G$ is no longer a basic empirical constant but becomes a derived constant that can be expressed in terms of the more fundamental Zhang Xiangqian Constant $Z$ and the speed of light $c$: $G = 2Z/c$.

This change in positioning reflects a profound revolution in our understanding of the nature of gravity and spacetime.

### 15.2 Unification Mechanism of Forces

Classical physics describes the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force) separately, without revealing their common origin. However, in Unified Field Theory, all forces are considered manifestations of different motion states of space:

1. **Gravity**: Caused by the divergence of spatial motion.
2. **Electromagnetic Force**: Caused by the curl of spatial motion.
3. **Strong Nuclear Force**: Caused by the high-frequency vibration of space.
4. **Weak Nuclear Force**: Caused by the breaking and recombination of spatial displacement lines.

This unified mechanism of forces provides us with a new perspective to understand the fundamental structure of the universe.

### 15.3 Physical Image Differences

There are significant differences in the physical images described by classical physics and Unified Field Theory:

1. **Nature of Space and Time**: Classical physics regards space and time as independent entities, while Unified Field Theory holds that space and time are essentially the same physical entity, and time is the movement of space.

2. **Nature of Matter**: Classical physics regards matter as composed of particles with mass, while Unified Field Theory holds that matter is a manifestation of the condensation of spatial motion.

3. **Nature of Forces**: Classical physics regards forces as interactions between objects, while Unified Field Theory holds that forces are effects caused by the motion of space itself.

These physical image differences reflect the revolutionary nature of Unified Field Theory compared to classical physics.

### 15.4 Comparison with Historical Attempts at Unified Field Theory

Unified Field Theory has a long history, with many physicists, including Einstein, attempting to establish a unified theory of the fundamental forces. Compared with these historical attempts, Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory has the following characteristics:

1. **Starting from Spatial Dynamics**: Unlike other theories that start from mathematical formalism, Unified Field Theory starts from the study of the motion of space itself, providing a more intuitive physical picture.

2. **Successful Derivation of Gravitational Constant**: Unified Field Theory successfully derives the gravitational constant from first principles, which is a breakthrough that previous theories failed to achieve.

3. **Broad Applicability**: Unified Field Theory can explain a wide range of physical phenomena, from macroscopic gravitational phenomena to microscopic quantum phenomena.

Although Unified Field Theory still needs more experimental verification, it provides a new approach for achieving the grand goal of unifying the four fundamental forces.

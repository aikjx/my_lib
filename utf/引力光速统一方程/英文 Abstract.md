## Abstract

Based on the complete formula system of Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory, this paper systematically derives the mathematical expression of the gravitational constant $G$, and establishes a quantitative relationship between $G$ and the speed of light $c$. The derivation process comprehensively utilizes the mass definition equation, spacetime geometric model, and field interaction theory within this framework, ultimately arriving at the core expression:  $G = \frac{2Z}{c}$  This formula is designated as the Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation. Here, $Z$ is a theoretical constant with the dimension of $[T^{-1} L^{-3}]$ (corresponding to the rate of change of spatial displacement lines per unit time per unit volume, i.e., the density flow of spatial divergence). Acknowledging the foundational contributions of Mr. Zhang Xiangqian's Unified Field Theory to this research, this constant is named the Zhang Xiangqian Constant. When assigning the Zhang Xiangqian Constant the value $Z = 0.01$, the theoretically calculated gravitational constant is:  $G_{\text{theory}} = 6.67128190396304 \times 10^{-11}  \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$ This result shows a high degree of agreement with the CODATA 2018 recommended value:  $G_{\text{CODATA}} = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11}  \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$ with a relative error of only 0.045%. Furthermore, this paper conducts cross-validation by incorporating this relationship into the electromagnetic field equations and dynamical equations within the unified field theory, confirming its strong theoretical self-consistency. Importantly, this study demonstrates that the Gravitational Light Speed Unification Equation possesses universality across multiple physical domains, including general relativity, quantum gravity, and cosmology. This relationship profoundly reveals the intrinsic unity between gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, providing a key mathematical bridge for constructing a Unified Field Theory. This theory also lays a mathematical and physical foundation for "Artificial field technology" and the Zhang Xiangqian Constant is anticipated to play a central role in the future development of interstellar civilization.

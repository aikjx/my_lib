# --- Given values ---
Z = 0.0100065  # kg^-1 * m^4 * s^-3 (from equation 10-9)
c = 299792458  # m/s (speed of light)

# --- Theoretical Calculation of G ---
# Equation (13-1): G = 2Z / c
G_calculated = (2 * Z) / c

# --- CODATA 2018 Recommended Value for G ---
# This is the accepted experimental value for comparison.
# You would typically look this up from a reliable source like NIST or CODATA.
G_codata_2018 = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 * kg^-1 * s^-2

# --- Verification and Error Calculation ---

# Calculate the absolute error
absolute_error = abs(G_calculated - G_codata_2018)

# Calculate the relative error
# We use the CODATA value as the reference for relative error.
# Avoid division by zero if G_codata_2018 is zero (which it isn't here).
if G_codata_2018 != 0:
    relative_error = (absolute_error / G_codata_2018) * 100  # in percentage
else:
    relative_error = float('inf') # Or handle as an error case

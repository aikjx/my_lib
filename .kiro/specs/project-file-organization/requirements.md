# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a comprehensive file organization system for the unified field theory research project. The current workspace contains scattered files across multiple directories with mixed languages (Chinese and English), inconsistent naming conventions, and unclear hierarchical structure. The goal is to establish a clean, logical, and maintainable file organization system that supports efficient research workflow and collaboration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a clear directory structure that separates different types of content (papers, code, documentation, etc.), so that I can quickly locate and manage project files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL create distinct top-level directories for different content types (research, code, documentation, resources)
2. WHEN creating directory structure THEN the system SHALL use consistent English naming conventions for all directory names
3. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL maintain logical hierarchical relationships between related files
4. WHEN restructuring THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing file content without data loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want consistent file naming conventions throughout the project, so that files are easily identifiable and searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN renaming files THEN the system SHALL use kebab-case or snake_case naming conventions consistently
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names that clearly indicate file purpose and content
3. WHEN handling multilingual content THEN the system SHALL standardize on English filenames with language indicators where needed
4. WHEN organizing by date THEN the system SHALL use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for chronological organization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want archived and historical files to be properly organized, so that I can access previous versions while keeping the main workspace clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing historical files THEN the system SHALL move .history contents to a dedicated archive directory
2. WHEN archiving THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological organization of historical versions
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove or relocate temporary and duplicate files
4. WHEN archiving THEN the system SHALL preserve file relationships and context information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want specialized directories for different research phases and outputs, so that I can manage the research workflow effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing research content THEN the system SHALL create separate directories for papers, analysis, verification, and publication materials
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate scripts, tools, and visualization components
3. WHEN organizing documentation THEN the system SHALL distinguish between project documentation, research notes, and reference materials
4. WHEN creating structure THEN the system SHALL include README files in major directories to explain their purpose and contents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the file organization to support both current work and future expansion, so that the structure remains useful as the project grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing structure THEN the system SHALL create scalable directory hierarchies that can accommodate new content
2. WHEN organizing THEN the system SHALL use modular organization that allows easy addition of new research areas
3. WHEN structuring THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing tools and workflows (.obsidian, .vscode, etc.)
4. WHEN implementing THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration path from current to new organization
